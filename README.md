# ⏱️ TimeTracker API  
A minimal and clean Work Session Tracking Service built with **.NET 10** and **Visual Studio 2026**.  
This API allows users to start a session, stop it, check the current status, see the total accumulated work time, and reset all in-memory data.

This project is designed as a lightweight, educational, and portfolio-ready backend implementation.

## Features

- **Start** a work session  
- **Stop** and get the duration + auto-generated productivity comment  
- **Check Status** (is the timer running? when did it start?)  
- **Total Work Time** accumulated across all sessions  
- **Reset** all in-memory data (clears active timer + total)

Runs entirely in RAM for ultra-fast performance.  
Perfect for demos, tutorials, and backend fundamentals.
